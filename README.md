## `About`
Website for a small dashboard assignment.

## `Api information`
Used a [currency converter API found here.](https://fixer.io/). Aswell as [this one](https://openweathermap.org/) for the weather.

## `Things i could improve!`
- Improve visuals, the site is rather dull to look at.
- Enable the user to input more stuff on the "postit" component, aswell as a delete/edit button for each one.
- Tidy the ReactJS, i belive there are a few places where my code could improve.
