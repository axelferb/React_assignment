## `About`
Website for a small dashboard assignment.

## `Api information`
Used a [currency converter API found here.](https://fixer.io/). Aswell as [this one](https://openweathermap.org/) for the weather.

## `Basic workprocess`
Started out with making a basic html/css layout. Then used that basic layout for pretty much the whole JS part of the site. last thing i did was to enhance the visuals a bit aswell as making it use localstorage.
### `Things i could improve!`
- Improve visuals, the site is rather dull to look at.
- Enable the user to input more stuff on the "postit" component, aswell as a delete/edit button for each one.
- Tidy the ReactJS, i belive there are a few places where my code could improve.
